HUB :

A hub stores various ports, so when a packet arrives at one port, it is copied to various other ports. 
Hub works as a common connection point for devices in a network.

1.A hub operates on the physical layer.
2.Hubs operates as a Layer 1 devices per the OSI model.
3.A network hub can't store MAC addresses.
4.Its speed is up to 10 Mbps
5.Does not use software	 and Not an intelligent device	

Switch :

A network switch is a computer networking device that connects various devices together on a single computer network
 It may also be used to route information in the form of electronic data sent over networks.
 Since the process of linking network segments is also called bridging, switches are usually referred to as bridging devices.

1.A switch operates on the data link layer.
2.Allow connecting multiple devices and ports.
3.Uses frame & packet
4.Speed 10/100 Mbps, 1 Gbps, 10 Gbps
5.Mostly comes with 24 to 48 ports

Router :

Routers are computer networking devices that serve two primary functions: (1) create and maintain a local area network
and (2) manage the data entering 
and leaving the network as well as data moving inside of the network.

1.Routers operate at Layer 3 (Network) of the OSI model.
2.Router will offer NAT (Network address translation (NAT))), NetFlow and QoS Services	
3.Store IP address in the routing table and maintain an address on its own.	
4.In Router, every port has its own broadcast domain.	
5.Router operations revolve around IP Addresses.	
6.Routers can work within both wired and wireless network situations.
